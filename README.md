Sample codes for the boto2 and boto3 library of AWS.

The samples are present in aws_python_sdk_samples/src/aws/aws.py for boto3 and aws_python_sdk_samples/src/aws/aws_boto2.py for boto2. They are intended to be used as helper methods for performing CRUD operations on AWS VM.

Contributions are invited. :)
